## 🏗 What We Are Building

We are solving the "2,000 Apps per Role" problem using sophisticated engineering:
- **Reactive Matching Engine:** Using Vert.x to handle high-concurrency candidate processing.
- **Anti-Bot & Anti-Fraud:** Proprietary logic to identify and filter the 20% of fraudulent/AI-generated applications in real-time.
- **Serverless Ecosystem:** Building a cost-effective, highly available platform using AWS Lambda and Next.js.
