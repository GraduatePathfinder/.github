# Graduate Pathfinder 🚀

### Fixing the STEM Recruitment Crisis with Code and Compassion.

Graduate Pathfinder is not just a career partner; we are a **tech-first platform** building the tools to fix a broken entry-level job market. We believe that behind every "automated rejection" is a talented individual, and behind every "noisy application" is an employer looking for a human connection.

We build technology to eliminate fraud, bypass the noise, and ensure that real STEM talent gets seen by real people.

## 🏗 What We Are Building

We don't just post jobs; we build solutions. Our current engineering focus includes:
- **Verification Logic:** Algorithms to identify and filter the 20% of fraudulent/AI-generated applications that plague employers.
- **Skill-Matching Engine:** Moving beyond keywords to understand the actual technical potential of a candidate.
- **Developer Tools:** Open-source resources (like our Astro-based Linktree) to help graduates present themselves better.
